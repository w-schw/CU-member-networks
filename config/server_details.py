# INSTRUCTIONS
# Replace the xxxx with the name of your sql server and the name of the Database
# If your SQLITE dummy db is in another directory from the script, you can update that as well.
#
# NOTE: retain the quotation marks around the server and db name.
# NOTE: DO NOT alter the variable names, ie the text 'MSSQL_server_name' and
# 'datamart_name'. If you change them the program will not run.
#
# Example of what it should look like:
# MSSQL_server_name = 'my-server'
# datamart_name = 'my-datamart'
#################################################

# replace the content between the '' ONLY
MSSQL_server_name = 'xxxx'
datamart_name = 'xxxx'

# only change this if your dummy database is in another directory
sqlite_location = 'member_net\\demo_data.db'
